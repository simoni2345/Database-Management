-- 8) Essay Question 

-- What are check constraints? 
-- Check constraints are used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column. CHECK constraints enforce domain integrity by limiting the values that are accepted by one or more columns. You can create a CHECK constraint with any logical (Boolean) expression that returns TRUE or FALSE based on the logical operators. 

-- Advantages of Check constraints?
-- By using check constraints, I can ensure that my database only contains data that passes certain constraints. This will allow me to let the database engine control data validation. Having check constraints is a clean way of performing data validation.

-- Good Example: 
-- Range of values for a salary column. 
-- The range can be limited by creating a CHECK constraint that allows for only Data that ranges from $10,000 through $200,000. This would prevent salaries from being entered beyond the regular salary range. Salary >= 10000 AND salary <= 200000

-- NOT NULL constraint â†’ NOT NULL is exceptionally useful when we have a table with columns that are critical to the definition of that data structure. For instance, an account without a name would be potentially meaningless,

-- You can apply multiple check constraints to a single column.

-- Bad Example: 
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
-- Product_id PRIMARY KEY
-- Product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
-- Manufacturer TEXT CHECK (Manufacturer > 0)
-- );
-- This would be a bad example of having check constraint as you cannot have a data type of text and then compare it with a numeric value.
